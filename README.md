# gopherpen [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gopherjs/gopherpen.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gopherjs/gopherpen) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopherjs/gopherpen?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopherjs/gopherpen)

Gopherpen is a project template that will let you easily get started with GopherJS
for building a web app. It includes some simple HTML, CSS, and Go code for the frontend.
Make some changes, and refresh in browser to see results. When there are errors in your
frontend Go code, they will show up in the browser console.

Once you're done making changes, you can easily create a fully self-contained static
production binary.
