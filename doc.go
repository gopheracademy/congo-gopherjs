// Gopherpen is a project template that will let you easily get started with GopherJS
// for building a web app. It includes some simple HTML, CSS, and Go code for the frontend.
// Make some changes, and refresh in browser to see results. When there are errors in your
// frontend Go code, they will show up in the browser console.
//
// Once you're done making changes, you can easily create a fully self-contained static
// production binary.
